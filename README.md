# Trace112
## Description
Trace 112 is a 2D drawing game where players must draw line
or shapes to avoid obstacles and get to the end of every level. Players move a 2D
character using arrow keys (left, right) and levels are randomly generated. 
Obstacles will include random shapes â€“ some that are static and others that are 
moving. Everytime the player hits an obstacle, they lose one life (represented 
as hearts) with each player having a total of three lives. Once all three lives 
are used, the player must restart. Players win by reaching 3 goals (represented 
as stars).
